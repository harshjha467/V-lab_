Microscopy, a technique using magnifying instruments, enables the determination of particle size and size distribution by visually observing and measuring individual particles under magnification. This method is particularly useful for analyzing materials with larger particle sizes, where image analysis software helps in quantifying and characterizing particle dimensions and shapes.
